# LangGraph.js Agent Version of the MCP Typescribe Tool

## What it does

The ReAct agent:

1. Takes a user **query** as input
2. Reasons about the query and decides on an action
3. Executes the chosen action using available tools
4. Observes the result of the action
5. Repeats steps 2-4 until it can provide a final answer

## Getting Started

Assuming you have already [installed LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio?tab=readme-ov-file#download), to set up:

1. Create a `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
