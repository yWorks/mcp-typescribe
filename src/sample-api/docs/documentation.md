# Task Management API Overview

The Task Management API provides a comprehensive solution for managing tasks, users, and task assignments in TypeScript. Despite some unusual naming conventions (which appear to be German-influenced), the API offers a robust set of functionalities.

## Core Components

### 1. Task Interface ({@link Uffgabe})

This is the base interface for tasks with properties like:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `do_Tittel`: Task title
- `umWosGoots`: Task description
- `assignee`: User assigned to the task
- `dueDate`: Due date
- `status`: Current status
- `priority`: Priority level
- `data`: Custom data associated with the task

### 2. Concrete Task Implementation ({@link taschg-maenaedscha!TaschgInEcht})

This class implements the `Uffgabe` interface and adds functionality like:

- `createdAt` and `updatedAt`: Timestamps for tracking task lifecycle
- `delegiera()`: Assigns tasks to users
- `korrigiera()`: Updates task status with history tracking
- `ojeZuSpaet()`: Checks if a task is overdue
- `wasWarDavor()`: Gets the status history of a task

### 3. Task Manager ({@link taschg-maenaedscha!TaschgMaenaedscha})

Manages collections of tasks with methods like:

- `bauWatt()`: Creates new tasks
- `iWillAelles()`: Gets all tasks
- `holsFuerEnKerle()`: Gets tasks assigned to a specific user
- `holsMir()`: Gets tasks filtered by status
- `suchs()`: Gets a task by ID
- `wechDamit()`: Deletes a task

### 4. Enums

- `{@link TaskStatus}`: Defines possible statuses (PENDING, LAEUFT, FERTIG, MIST)
- `{@link Priority}`: Defines priority levels (WENIG, GEHT_SO, SCHNELL, UI_UI_UI)

### 5. User Interface ({@link Kerle})

Represents users with properties:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `soi_name`: Full name
- `internet_brief`: Email address
- `role`: Role in the system

### 6. Utility Functions

- `calculateEstimatedCompletion()`: Estimates task completion time
- `filterTasks()`: Filters tasks by various criteria
- `formatTask()`: Formats task information as strings
- `isAdmin()`: Type guard to check if a user has admin role
- `kopiera()`: Creates a deep copy of a task
- `sortByDueDate()`: Sorts tasks by due date
- `sortByPriority()`: Sorts tasks by priority
- `summarizeTasksByStatus()`: Generates task summaries grouped by status

## Working with Tasks

To use this API effectively, you would typically:

1. Create a task manager instance
2. Create tasks using the manager
3. Assign tasks to users
4. Update task status as they progress
5. Filter and sort tasks as needed for display or reporting

The API also includes error handling classes like `{@link UffgabeFaehler}` (base error class) and `{@link UffgabeWechFaehler}` (for when tasks are not found).
